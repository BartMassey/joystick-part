# Joystick Part
Copyright &copy; 2016 Bart Massey and Mike Haertel

This repo contains [FreeCAD](http://freecadweb.org) and
[STL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29)
files for a replacement stick for a third-party Commodore 64
joystick made by RetroBit.

A previous iteration of this part was printed and
successfully used. One hole needed to be drilled out, an
aluminum-foil shim was needed to make the spacing come out
right, and there were other print quality issues. It is
believed that this iteration fixes things.

There is one sketch in the FreeCAD file that is a reference
sketch for construction purposes only.
